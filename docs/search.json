    "text": "My two broad scientific interests are the evolutionary processes determining microbe-host interactions and the role of the microbiome in fighting infections. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in Dr. Megan Behringer’s lab at Vanderbilt University. We are working to understand the evolution of lactic acid bacteria that live in the bladder and how they may protect against urinary tract infections.\nBefore starting my doctoral training in 2021, I graduated from Georgia Tech where I earned a B.S. in Biology. There, I worked with Dr. Amit Reddi and Dr. Rebecca Donegan to uncover the intricacies of mycobacterial heme homeostasis. I also did an industry co-op developing microbial treatments to increase crop yield and carbon sequestration at Indigo Agriculture, Inc. and studied alcohol addiction pathogenesis in Dr. Gilles Martin’s lab at UMass Medical School.\nOutside the lab, I am an avid New England sports fan and cook."

    "text": "Current Projects\n\nMicrobiome targeted therapy for recurrent urinary tract infections\nIn collaboration with clinicians at the Mayo Clinic I am evaluating the efficacy of a microablative vaginal laser treatment for preventing recurrent urinary tract infections in postmenopausal women. I will be using metagenomic sequencing to determine if the treatment causes changes in the urogenital microbiome that are associated with decreased UTI incidence such as increasing Lactobacillus abundance. View details at ClinicalTrials.gov. \n\n\nEcology and evolution of bladder bacteria\nLactic acid bacteria are fastidious anaerobes and are understudied despite their industrial applications and associations with human health benefits. These bugs are known to inhibit the growth of pathogens like E. coli and may be critical for preventing UTIs. My goal is to understand the mechanisms driving the evolution of these microbes in vitro and in the human microbiome using a variety of experimental evolution and computational methods.\n\n\n\nPast Projects\n\nMycobacterial heme homeostasis\nMycobacterium tuberculosis is the second deadliest pathogen and the deadliest bacterium. While progress has been made in fighting tuberculosis, antimicrobial resistance in this pathogen is growing rapidly. The need for new therapies requires us to understand new potential targets. Heme is an essential cofactor required by M. tuberculosis for respiration, gas sensing, neutralizing reactive oxygen species, and other processes necessary for pathogenesis. However, the reactivity that makes it so useful as a cofactor also makes it toxic. Free heme can dangerously alter proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids resulting in cell death. Using the model mycobacterium, Mycobacterium smegmatis, I identified physiologically relevant contitions that altered heme synthesis and bioavailability. My work on this project contributed to a paper driven by lead author Dr. Rebecca Donegan that described idiosyncratic patterns in mycobacterial heme homeostasis and showed that heme synthesis may be a promising drug target.\n\n\nAgricultural Microbiomes\nIndigo Agriculture produces staple crop seeds treated with microbes which increase yield and can protect plants from stresses like drought or fungal infection. I screened pairs of microbes for antagonism using in vitro and in planta assays to determine if they were compatible for coinnoculation. I also contributed to a metabolite function knowledge base to enhance genome motivated microbe nominations.\n\n\nElectrophysiology of alcohol addiction\nAlcohol addiction is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality and it is believed that binge drinking may play a causal role in its pathogenesis. Working in Dr. Gilles Martin’s lab at UMass Medical School, I performed mouse husbandry and set up whole-cell patch clamping experiments aimed at determining how binge drinking may lead to alcohol addiction. I also completed a small project aimed at addressing a major issue common in animal research: the exclusion of female research subjects. This causes two major problems. If there is no sex difference in the phenomenon being studied, the researchers cannot know if the results are generalizable to female animals. If there is a sex difference, it cannot be detected. This problem is being prioritized by NIH. My goal was to understand if there is a difference in alcohol consumption between male and female mice so that the lab could confidently move forward with including female mice in future experiments. There was no difference."
