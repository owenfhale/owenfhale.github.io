While performing the correlation, many transform and/or normalize their data. They then make a scatterplot of the raw abundance data against the metadata. This makes it impossible to evaluate the quality of the correlation from the plot, which eliminates the purpose of it’s existence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nC. Li. 2023.

While progress has been made in fighting tuberculosis, antimicrobial resistance in this pathogen is growing rapidly. The need for new therapies requires us to understand new potential targets. Heme is an essential cofactor required by M. tuberculosis for respiration, gas sensing, neutralizing reactive oxygen species, and other processes necessary for pathogenesis. However, the reactivity that makes it so useful as a cofactor also makes it toxic. Free heme can dangerously alter proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids resulting in cell death. Using the model mycobacterium, Mycobacterium smegmatis, I identified physiologically relevant contitions that altered heme synthesis and bioavailability. My work on this project contributed to a larger project driven by Dr. Rebecca Donegan that described idiosyncratic patterns in mycobacterial heme homeostasis and showed that heme synthesis may be a promising drug target.\nRead the paper\n\n\nAgricultural microbiomes\nIndigo Agriculture produces staple crop seeds treated with microbes which increase yield and can protect plants from stresses like drought or fungal infection. I screened pairs of microbes for antagonism using in vitro and in planta assays to determine if they were compatible for coinnoculation. I also contributed to a metabolite function knowledge base to enhance genome motivated microbe nominations.\n\n\nElectrophysiology of alcohol addiction\nAlcohol addiction is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality and it is believed that binge drinking may play a causal role in its pathogenesis.
