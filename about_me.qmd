My two broad scientific interests are the evolutionary processes determining microbe-host interactions and the role of the microbiome in fighting infections. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in [Dr. Megan Behringer's lab](https://behringerlab.wixsite.com/index) at Vanderbilt University. We are working to understand the evolution of lactic acid bacteria that live in the bladder and how they may protect against urinary tract infections.

Before starting my doctoral training in 2021, I graduated from Georgia Tech where I earned a B.S. in Biology. There, I worked with Dr. Amit Reddi and Dr. Rebecca Donegan to uncover the intricacies of mycobacterial heme homeostasis. I also did an industry co-op developing microbial treatments to increase crop yield and carbon sequestration at Indigo Agriculture, Inc. and studied alcohol addiction pathogenesis in Dr. Gilles Martin's lab at UMass Medical School.

Outside the lab, I am an avid New England sports fan and cook.
